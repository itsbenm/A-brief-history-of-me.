Hello, I am Adam Eiffert, a year 13 student from Kent. I am currently sudying Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Computer Science, Chemistry 
and am also participating in an EPQ. I am currently creating a setup for AI to play Sevens against each other until an 'optimal' solution is 
found. I am also researching the argument of how strong encryption should be allowed to be as part of my EPQ.
