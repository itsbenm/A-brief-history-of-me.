<h1>Computer Science</h1>
<p>I am currently particpating in the Computer Science A2 level qualification. As part of this, I have been researching the how to code AI. To do this, I have created a platform in which a user is able to put AI against each other in a game of Sevens until an 'optimal' solution is found. This has been interesting as it is soemthing that is not taught in detail during the syllabus.</p>
